/**
 * Session state for the whole app. This is the authoritative description of the
 * auth model; other auth files carry a pointer here rather than repeating it.
 *
 * The token is never visible to JavaScript. Both the access and refresh tokens
 * are HttpOnly cookies, so nothing in this file can read, decode, or inspect
 * them — an XSS bug cannot exfiltrate a session. Everything below follows from
 * that constraint:
 *
 * - Expiry comes from `accessExpiresAt`, a timestamp the server puts in the
 *   response BODY, because the token itself is unreadable. jwtUtils.decodeJwt
 *   exists for display only and must never be treated as authoritative.
 * - A refresh is scheduled 2 minutes before expiry rather than reacting to a
 *   401, so a user mid-action is not interrupted by a failed request.
 * - `visibilitychange` re-checks on tab wake. setTimeout does not fire reliably
 *   in a backgrounded tab, so a timer set an hour ago may be arbitrarily late;
 *   on wake we refresh immediately if within a minute of expiry, otherwise
 *   reschedule against the real clock.
 * - The `fyredocs:unauthorized` window event is the inbound channel from
 *   lib/apiClient.ts. An event rather than a direct call keeps apiClient
 *   independent of the React tree, at the cost of the coupling being invisible
 *   to the type system — if you rename that event, grep for it.
 *
 * Bootstrap is a deliberate ladder: getMe, then refresh if that fails, then give
 * up and clear. A returning user with an expired access token but a live refresh
 * token must land authenticated, which one getMe call alone cannot achieve.
